**Description:**  
Simple rougelike where you play as a person crawling through a dungeon, defeating monsters
and going deeper and deeper in to the dungeon. Just making this for fun.  
I extensively followed the tutorial found at http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod
Now that I have the base game fleshed out I can start working on more interesting things.

**How to Play:**  
To get the game running all you need is Python 2.7 installed on your machine. I have not tested 
with any other version of python. Just run it like you would any other Python file and 
it should work just fine.

**Instructions:**  
You can use lower case button presses for all commands in game, I just use caps here for clarity.  
* Mouse over a tile to see what is on it.  
* Arrows keys - move and attack monsters  
* A-Z while in menu to make choices  
* Alt+Enter   - Toggle full-screen  
* I           - Open inventory  
* D           - Open inventory to drop items  
* C           - Character statistics  
* G           - pick up items on the ground   
* P           - Toogle Play/Pause  
* R when dead - Revives player  
* Esc in game - Saves and quits to main menu  
* >           - Go down stairs, advancing in the dungeon
